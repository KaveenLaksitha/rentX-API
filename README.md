## About

The automobile rental management system is a web application developed for the purpose of managing vehicle reservations under two major
categories: 
- renting vehicles for daily requirements
-  reserving a set of vehicles as event reservations.

The system would be beneficial for several stakeholders such as rental company owners, managers, administrators, drivers, and customers/clients. However, the system would mainly be handled by the company administrators under four significant functions.   The   four   primary   functions   are   employee   management, vehicle management, rental process management, and event reservation management.
Under employee management, the application would facilitate the administrator to handle details of the new recruiting or already recruited employees by providing the necessary insert, update, delete, view, and search functions. For vehicle management administrator is facilitated with the opportunity to handle registering of new vehicles with the system from external clients and company-owned vehicles so that they can be used for renting and event reservations. Thereby insert function is developed to create new vehicle records within the system. In order to manage the details of such created vehicle records, update, delete, view, and search functions are developed. Under the rental process management renting vehicles for daily vehicle requirements of customers is managed. The available vehicles can be rented for a specific period (agreed rental period). In case of a late return of the vehicle, penalty charges get applied on the final payment. Thereby to handle these scenarios, firstly administrator is facilitated with an insert function to insert a new rental record and then update, delete view search, and payment calculation functions are facilitated to manipulate the inserted records and complete the rental process upon the returning of vehicle by customers. Event reservation management allows customers to make reservations on multiple numbers of vehicles at the same time for specific events for an agreed time period. Such event reservation records are facilitated to be inserted into the system as event reservation records by the insert function, whereas handling of the inserted record details at the end of the agreed period is facilitated with the update, delete, view, and search functions. However, the event reservations which do not get completed within the agreed time period due to the reasoning of customers not returning all the vehicles on time are handled under the payment function.
